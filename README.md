# LeetCode Solutions 👩‍💻🚀

Welcome to my collection of LeetCode solutions! This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, organized by difficulty and problem type. Each solution is implemented in one or more programming languages. 🌟

## What languages you are going to see around here:

The main languages that I am focusing at the moment is python and C. However I am also exploring databases and algos, so you can also find some SQL!

## Wanna find out how they are being used? 🛠️

1. Navigate to the difficulty folder until you found the problem you're interested in.  
2. Open the file for the language you prefer.  
3. Run the code in your favorite IDE or environment!  

## About the Solutions and Comments 💡

Feel free to explore and adapt them for your own learning or projects. Also, I am always open to feedback, so if you have a better way of resolving a problem don't hold yourself back to share it or discuss with a pull or a discussion here on github!  

Happy coding! 🧩✨
